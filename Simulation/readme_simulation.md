Scripts simulations.R summarize the setup for generating data and implementation of the methods in our simulation studies. We recommand using multiple clusters for parallel and replicate each setting for many times (says 300), and summarizing the paralleled results to estimate the average power, FDR and consumed time of the included algorithms. 

The setups inlcude: 
1. Moderate size simulations
2.
